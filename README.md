Course Project- Data Science Course Directory
Coursera requires the creation of a Repo for its Data Scientists Toolbox Course which will contain a markdown file labeled "HelloWorld."
The file will be generated in RStudio and pushed to github master repo.
This will be made available via link to class members to review the final project and answer yes or no questions based on the submission.
Each course member must review the projects of two classmates.
